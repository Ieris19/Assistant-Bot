Ieris Assistant
===============
A Discord's admin best friend.

This bot is **under development** to cater to my specific needs as an admin.
This means that the bot's scope is broad and requires high level of permissions
within a server. This is to ensure the bot's ability to carry out
***any and all*** duties that I might need it to.

For now, these are the features that it contains:

# Features:

* Slash commands:
  * /minecraft => Provides the IP of the Minecraft Server
  * /report => Provides information about how to Report errors
